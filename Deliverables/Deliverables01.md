### Group 02 – “Musical Chord Progression Generator”

## **1\.** Introduction

When making music, musicians often start by choosing something called a chord progression–a sequence of chords used as the backing to a piece of music. Many cultures have a tendency to stick to certain progressions, such as I-vi-IV-V in Western culture and vi-IV-V-iii in East Asian culture. In some cases, this can lead to a piece lacking identity—an inability to meaningfully distinguish it from others of the same genre, and consequently being labeled “generic.” As it is difficult to find chord progressions that go against the norm yet still sound “good,” our web application aims to suggest a wide range of chord progressions to the user, giving them the ability to listen and test suggestions on the go. It is our intention to streamline the complex process of composing music—and make learning how to do so more accessible in the process.
